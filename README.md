# Project File Overview

## page.tsx (located at /app/page.tsx)
- Renders the homepage and controls the navigation/image/etc components.

## layout.tsx (located at /app/layout.tsx)
- Defines the common layout and structure for the entire site, providing consistent styling and structure across pages.

## images.ts (located at /app/utils/images.ts)
- Used to load and categorize images automatically/directly from the /public/images folder.

## images Folder (located at /public/images)
- Put image assets here. This folder is designed so you just drop images for the site into it and then images.ts does the rest (kinda).

## favicon.ico (located at /app/favicon.ico)
- The site's favicon displayed in browser tabs, you can change it (carefully) but the site needs one or it will break lol.
