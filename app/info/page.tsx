          Bridget Lai (b. 2000, Minneapolis, MN) is a photographer based in New York whose work is primarily collaged self-portraiture in which she assumes the role of a girl between modes of work and play. Her pieces ask how coding labor via cuteness can affect its visibility, and how entropy is a variable in its relationship. In 2022, Lai received her BFA in Photography from Parsons School of Design.
